# MazeSolver
A lightweight Python project that solves mazes using BFS and A* search. Compares path length, explored nodes, and runtime to show how heuristics improve efficiency. Dependency-free, easy to run, and ideal for learning AI pathfinding and search strategies.


# 🎮 Controls Inside the Window

These are built directly into the code I gave you:

## Key	Action
```
C: Toggle comparison mode
1/2/3: Change difficulty (works in both modes)
R: Regenerate maze (works in both modes)
B/A: Switch algorithms (only in single mode)
ESC: Quit
```
